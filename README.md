Schematic Utility is a basic Minecraft plugin that allows you to load and paste WorldEdit schematic files at a given location.

## Features
* Load schematics at a specific location.
* Load schematics in another world.
* Allows you to use command blocks or the console to paste schematics.

### Whats New in 1.2? ðŸš€
Version 1.2 is the second public release and we've introduced a config file! ðŸŽ‰
You can now set a custom message when a schematic is loaded (or disable it ðŸ˜Ž, totally up to you)

## Commands
* /su help <page>
  * Shows the help menu.
* /su load <filename> <world> <x> <y> <z>
  * Load and paste structure from the schematic file.
* /su reload
  * Reloads the config.

## Permissions
* schematics.load
  * Allows access to _/su load_ and _/su help_
* schematics.admin
  * Allows access to all commands.
 
## config.yml
```
messages:
    load: "%filename% has been loaded."
    
    # Setting this to false will disable the load message
    enabled: true
    
    # Placeholders
    # %filename% - Schematic file name
```

## Dependencies
 This plugin requires [WorldEdit](https://dev.bukkit.org/projects/worldedit) to be installed.
