Schematic Utility is a basic Minecraft plugin that allows you to load and paste WorldEdit schematic files at a given location.

## Features
* Load schematics at a specific location.
* Load schematics in another world.
* Allows you to use command blocks or the console to paste schematics.

## What's New in 1.3-beta.1? ðŸš€
- Integrated WorldEdit's `-a` air flag.
- Load command is now:
  - `/su load <filename> <world> <x> <y> <z> [-a]`
- Help menu will only show commands that users have permissions for.

## Commands
* `/su help [page]`
  * Shows the help menu.
* `/su load <filename> <world> <x> <y> <z> [-a]`
  * Load and paste structure from the schematic file.
* `/su reload`
  * Reloads the config.

## Permissions
